# Wordpress sucks and you know it

Just a boilerplate project I use to build child themes when I'm really forced to use WP.

Meant to extend the Hello-Elementor child theme with a single.php template.

WP is run as a docker container and the child theme is mounted from the host using volumes in the docker-compose.yml
